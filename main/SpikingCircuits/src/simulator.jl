"""
    SpikingSimulator

A event-based simulator for the `Spiking` target.

At any time during simulation, each component has a `State`
and a `Trajectory`.  A `t::Trajectory` describes how the state will evolve
over the next `trajectory_length(t)` milliseconds if no input spikes are received in this time.
A trajectory may specify the next output spike which will be emmitted from this component if no inputs are received.
`next_spike(::Component, t::Trajectory)` returns `nothing` if the trajectory does not extend to a time
when the component emits an output spike, or `output_name` if it does.
If the trajectory extends to a spike emission, `trajectory_length(t)` is the time of this spike emission.

The function `extend_trajectory(::Component, ::State, t::Trajectory)` returns the a new `trajectory`
such that `trajectory_length(trajectory) > trajectory_length(t)`.  [TODO: do we want `>` or `≥`?]

The function `advance_time_by(::Component, ::State, t::Trajectory, ΔT)` returns
a tuple `(new_state, new_traj, output_spike_names)` giving a new state and trajectory
for the component obtained by advancing the time by `ΔT`, and an iterator over the names
of the outputs from this component which spiked during this time.  It is required
that `ΔT ≤ trajectory_length(t)`, so we are only advancing time to a point we have already
determined in the trajectory.  Note that this means that any spikes emitted by the component
are emitted at exactly time `ΔT`, since we require that any output spikes the trajectory `t`
includes occur at `trajectory_length(t)`.

The function `receive_input_spike(::Component, ::State, ::Trajectory, inname)`
returns a tuple `(new_state, new_traj, spiking_output_names)` of a new state and (possibly empty)
trajectory reflecting knowledge of the inputted spike.  `spiking_output_names` is an iterator
over the names of the component outputs which spike immediatly upon receiving this input spike.
This will often return an empty trajectory, since the old trajectory is rendered invalid by the knowledge
that a new spike arrived.

Currently the simulator operates on immutable objects; it may be more performant to move to mutable objects.

Note: I think that the code probably requires some condition about the order in which input spikes are received
and output spikes are emitted in one moment of time not mattering.  It may be worthwhile to articulate this at some point.
It may also be the right call to move to a simulator where nothing can happen at the same instant, and when things in theory happen
at the same instant, we instead sequence them with some tiny ϵ-milisecond delay instead.

Note that this condition, and the invariant that a trajectory length cannot extend past the next output spike,
implies that if `spiking_output_names` is not empty, then all spikes in `spiking_output_names`
occurred at exactly `ΔT` seconds.
