- [ ] `MultiLineProductPositiveReal` type for the GF output (or should the official abstract type still be `PositiveReal`, and the implementations just use `MultiLine...`?)
- [ ] Implement `CPTSample` and `CPTScore`
- [ ] `DistributionGenFn` should use `CPTSample` and `CPTScore`; `DeterministicGenFn` should use `LookupTable`
- [ ] Composite Generative Functions should not multiply together the prob outputs
