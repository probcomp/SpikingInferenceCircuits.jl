#### Model Compilation

##### High priority:
[x] Ensure compilation with `Map` combinator works
[x] Nested `Map` combinator
[x] Inline constant nodes
[ ] Test `Assess` for model with image output in simulator.

##### Medium priority:
[] Handle distributions like `VelCat` where we should construct a `LabeledCPT` by evaluating
function calls to fill in the probability table.
[] Handle tuples & tuple return values better
[] Handle GFs with no arguments
