#### Model Compilation

High priority:
- Ensure compilation with `Map` combinator works
- Nested `Map` combinator

Medium priority:
- Handle distributions like `VelCat` where we should construct a `LabeledCPT` by evaluating
function calls to fill in the probability table.
- Handle tuples & tuple return values better
